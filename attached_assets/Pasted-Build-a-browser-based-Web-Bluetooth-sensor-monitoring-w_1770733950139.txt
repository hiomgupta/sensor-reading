Build a browser-based Web Bluetooth sensor monitoring web application for academic lab use.

Core Objective

Create a zero-install web app that connects directly to a BLE-enabled ESP32 sensor, streams real-time data, visualizes it live, and allows one-click CSV export. The app must prioritize simplicity, reliability, and beginner usability.

Mandatory Constraints (Do NOT violate)

Web-only application (no mobile apps)

No user authentication

No paid services

No advanced IoT automation

No long-term analytics

Chrome / Edge browser support only

Focus on short academic experiment sessions

Tech Stack (Strict)

Frontend: React

Styling: Tailwind CSS

Charts: Chart.js

BLE: Web Bluetooth API (navigator.bluetooth)

Storage: Client-side memory only (CSV export required)

Optional (clearly modular): Firebase or Supabase for cloud sync

Core Features (Must Implement)

Landing Page

Title and short description

Single prominent “Connect Sensor” button

Clean academic UI

BLE Device Connection

Use Web Bluetooth API

Scan nearby BLE devices

Show device name and RSSI

Connect to ESP32 sensor

Subscribe to notification-based characteristic updates

Live Data Streaming

Receive sensor data every 1 second

Parse numeric values

Attach timestamps

Handle disconnects gracefully

Dashboard Visualization

Real-time line chart (Chart.js)

Numeric live sensor value display

Connection status indicator

Minimal, readable layout

CSV Export

One-click “Export CSV” button

CSV format: timestamp, sensor_name, value

No manual logging required

Device Management

Show connected device name

Disconnect / reconnect option

Reset session data

BLE Assumptions

Support ESP32-style BLE devices using:

One service UUID

One characteristic UUID

Notification-based data updates

Use placeholder UUIDs in code with clear comments for replacement.

UI Principles

Beginner-first

No BLE jargon exposed to user

Clear visual hierarchy

Demo-ready for classroom projection

Responsive but desktop-first

Error Handling

Browser compatibility check

BLE permission denial handling

Auto-reconnect attempt

Clear error messages (human-readable)

Deliverables

Fully working React app in Replit

Clean, commented code

Dummy data fallback if sensor not connected

Ready-to-demo state without external setup

Explicit Non-Goals (Do NOT implement)

Login systems

Notifications/alerts

Rule engines

Mobile app wrappers

Multi-protocol support (WiFi/MQTT by default)

Code Quality Requirements

Modular React components

Clear separation of BLE logic and UI

Comments explaining academic relevance

No overengineering

Final Instruction

Optimize for clarity, reliability, and academic defensibility, not feature count.
This project must clearly demonstrate that browser-native BLE can outperform mobile apps for academic sensor monitoring.
